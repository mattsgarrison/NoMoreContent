Cobbled together iOS9 app to enable content blocking. Nothing new or original to see here.


Open this up in your XCode 7 beta, compile and deploy it to you device.  

Settings > Safari > ContentBlockers should now have a toggle to block some advertising and 
make your mobile web experience all around better.
